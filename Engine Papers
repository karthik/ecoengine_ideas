Paper 1: Present Holos and make it citable 
This first paper will be a general presentation of the Holos: Berkeley Ecoinformatics Engine, including the tool’s overall aim and scope as well as its inner workings. This paper will represent the general citable reference for all Holos users.

Brief Description:
-	Why is Holos’ mission important? It is important to facilitate the integration of data and expertise necessary to develop an accurate understanding of species-environment interactions and feedbacks.
-	Why is the Holos tool necessary? Currently-available tools fall short of this objective: they rarely integrate specimen and environmental data; they rarely integrate different types of biological data (e.g., museum specimens and photos); they rarely enable users to conduct exploration and basic analysis of available data.
-	What is Holos?  An online tool for easy and rapid access to vast amounts of disparate data (on both biological and physical systems). It includes the ability to perform rapid exploratory analyses and tests for correlations, and the ability to visualize and communicate results to a broad community of users.
-	How does Holos work? Holos includes a number of data resources. It is built around an open API (Application Programming Interface) that will allow users to access those data resources in a variety of ways (i.e., Explorer Interface, Internally Developed Apps, Externally Developed Apps, Expert Analysis Tools). 
-	Where is Holos? How to access it.
-	How do you use Holos? A brief use case example. 
-	How will Holos be useful? Holos will promote the type of multi-disciplinary building that will lead to breakthroughs in our understanding of the biotic input and response to global change. It will serve to unite previously disconnected perspectives from paleo-ecologists, population biologists, and ecologists and make possible the testing of predictive models of global change, a critical advance in making the science more rigorous.

Paper 2: Highlight the research questions enabled by Holos and approaches to answer them 
This second paper will highlight the research opportunities enabled by the integration of varied data sources within the Holos: Berkeley Ecoinformatics Engine. This paper will include a series of case studies using our API to highlight best practices for making use of those data in order to answer timely global change biology research questions.

Brief Description:
-	In an ideal world, global change biology studies would have access to precise knowledge of the distribution and abundance of all taxa across the entire range of spatial (local to global) and temporal (from the taxon’s inception to the present) scales. Unfortunately, for many taxa, we still have inadequate knowledge of their global, regional, and even local distributions, let alone abundance, a problem that Lomolino (2004) has labelled the Wallacean shortfall (see also Linnean shortfall). 
-	Museums, private natural history collections, herbaria and the historical literature contribute a great deal to our current knowledge of the geographic distributions of many species. These data can be categorized broadly into three dimensions: (i) identity (with associated ancillary data regarding the natural history, biology, phenotype and genotype of individual organisms); (ii) space, and (iii) time. More and more of these data are being captured in electronic databases and made available through data portals on the internet (for a list of some of the major databases available, see Graham et al., 2004), although a vast number of records still remain to be computerized (O’Connell et al., 2004).
-	Unfortunately, the extent to which general biological collections can provide information of a geographic nature is often limited. For the most part, collections were made in a haphazard and opportunistic manner, largely dependent on the particular interests of the collector. As a result collections have mostly been made near centres of human activity and along the roads that join them, many areas have been under-sampled, substantial regions may not have been sampled at all, and numbers of recorded locations may be low.
-	Although museum collections are unlikely to give us an accurate representation of everything everywhere, they potentially hold essential information on aspects of species’ distributions of particular relevance to global change biology (e.g., phenology, range limits, species co-occurrence). However, relatively little attention has been given as to how to best to use these records to provide more reliable estimates of species’ distributions for answering questions relative to global change biology (except in the context of species distribution modelling). 
-	In this paper, we illustrate three approaches to overcome biases in museum data and retrieve fundamental information on species’ distributions which can be used in a number of global change biology applications:
1.	Coarsening spatial, temporal, environmental and/or taxonomic scale
2.	Focusing on aspects of species’ ranges such as range limits (e.g. altitudinal, latitudinal, phenological, environmental).
3.	Borrowing explanatory power from other datasets (i.e. different data source/types for a single species, different species within the same dataset, e.g. list length).

Paper 3: Answer one timely novel research question enabled by Holos 
This third paper will focus on a specific research question enabled by the integration of varied data sources within Holos. Specifically, we will focus on the question of direct versus indirect effects of climate change on the distribution of species. This timely and high-impact question can only be answered through the integration of climatic, vegetation, and animal distribution data across space and time.

Holos Resources Used: Data at two time periods during the 20th century will be used from the following sources: 1) PRISM climate layers; 2) VTM maps (in conjunction with CalVeg 2000); 3) GRP data for mammals, birds, herps; 4) Essig data on historical and modern Odonata surveys; 5) Miscellaneous event data assembled through the Engine (e.g., Arctos, Essig Database).
Brief Description:
-	This paper will investigate whether elevational shifts in a number of animal taxa during the 20th century have resulted principally from a) direct physiological responses to climate change, b) indirect responses to climate-induced changes in vegetation, c) indirect responses to climate-induced changes in interacting species, or d) other unaccounted drivers. 
-	The study area will likely be limited to a well-known and protected mountainous region with a high degree of overlap across datasets (e.g., Yosemite National Park). 
-	Species data to quantify animal elevational shifts (i.e., to compare elevational ranges between a historical and a modern time period) will be mainly obtained from the Grinnell Resurvey Project (GRP) – for bird, mammal and, hopefully, a few herptile species. These will potentially be complemented with other data sources such as historical and modern Odonata surveys from the Essig Museum and Arthur Shapiro’s butterfly monitoring sites (not a Holos resource!), if geographical overlap is sufficient and sampling biases can be controlled for.
-	Statistical significance of elevational shifts will be estimated using the established occupancy framework. 
-	Three types of predictor variables will be used, each corresponding to one of the three hypothesized drivers of elevational shift: change in climate variables calculated from PRISM data, change in habitat (i.e., vegetation) cover (historic data: Wieslander Vegetation Type Mapping (VTM) Project; modern data: CalVeg 2000), dynamics of co-occurring species (as calculated using the species data itself). 
-	Each species’ climatic niche, habitat niche and competing species will be estimated using California-wide event data assembled through the Engine. Ecological niches will be calibrated so as to maximize the fit to historical survey data along the study elevational gradient. 
-	Projections of elevational shift in the modern time period will be generated assuming species track individual ecological niche components (climate vs habitat vs co-occurring species) or particular combinations of them. 
-	Comparison of each species’ observed elevational shift with each model projection will reveal the principal driver(s) of each species’ shift. 
-	Additional analyses will reveal whether drivers of past elevational change vary with taxonomy, ecological traits, and/or phylogeny.
